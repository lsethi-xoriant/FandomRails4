Instructions for deployment with capistrano

To initialize a new server
--------------------------

1) Install your SSH public key on the server.

2) Copy the "init_server" directory in the /tmp folder of the server, and run the doit.sh script as root. 
WARNING: this script applies several changes to the system as root, it should be checked with care.
When prompted for the password of the app user, set it as per company policy.

3) When finished, edit the system configuration appropriately; for example edit /etc/nginx/sites-available/default to change the site virtual host.

Deploy with Capistrano
----------------------

to check if the repository is accessible from the server:

$ cap production git:check

to run a new deploy:
